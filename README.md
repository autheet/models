# Autheet App Dart Models Repository

This folder contains the Dart models used throughout the Autheet application. It serves as a central repository for the data structures that represent the core concepts of the Autheet protocol.

This space is intended for discussion, inspiration, and providing implementation hints related to these models and their usage, particularly concerning the unique Autheet handshake protocol. Developers and contributors are encouraged to use this folder as a reference point.

For detailed explanations of the models, including their serialization strategies, relationships, and role within the Autheet protocol, please refer to the dedicated document:
